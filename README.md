Our goal was to quantify the sentiment in the debate speeches of two presidential candidates. From the Brown corpus, we extracted the debate speeches of President John F. Kennedy and Dwight D. Eisenhower from July 25, 1961. We used a Sentiment Intensity Analyzer and used the following polarity metrics: -1 (negative), 0 (neutral), and 1 (positive). We then put certain keywords for the analyzer to filter through in order to gauge a sentiment.
